		<h2 class="promo__title  title"> Carroll Gardens House is nestled in the heart of Carroll Gardens, one of Brooklynâ€™s most charming brownstone neighborhoods. </h2>

		<div class="promo__col">
			<p> The apartment is one full floor of a brownstone: approximately 1000 square feet, with full kitchen, private bath, living/dining area, two bedrooms (each with a queen-size bed), small den and private outdoor deck. It's the ideal home base whether your
				visit is for business or pleasure. </p>
			<p> Enjoy the many amenities this wonderful setting has to offer. There are over 100 restaurants and cafes within walking distance, dozens of family-owned shops and local boutiques specializing in everything from children's clothing to housewares, and
				the beautiful Carroll Park directly across the street with 2 playgrounds, a softball field, a bocce court, 5 basketball courts, and a sprinkler in the summer. Our location just half block from the subway couldn't be more convenient as a home base
				from which to explore New York's most popular borough. </p>
